# 📚 Book Management System

A responsive and user-friendly Book Management System built with **React**, styled using **MUI** and **TailwindCSS**, and powered by **React Query** for efficient data fetching. The app uses **JSON Server** as a mock RESTful API for handling book records.

## 🚀 Features

- 📖 View a paginated list of books (10 per page)
- 🔍 Search books by title using the search bar in the header
- 🎯 Filter books by `Genre`, `Status`, or `Author`
- ➕ Add new books via a modal form
- ✏️ Edit existing book details
- 🗑️ Delete books with confirmation
- 📤 Uses **PUT** and **PATCH** for full or partial updates
- 🌐 Mock API powered by **JSON Server**

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-management-system.git
```

### 2. Move to Local Repository

```bash
cd book-management-system
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Local db.json Server

```bash
npm run json-server
```

>1) The local server runs at `http://localhost:3000/books`.
>2) The remote server runs at `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/VivekDahiya06/Book-Management-System/books`.

### 5. Start the React server in a new Terminal.

```bash
npm run dev
```

>Note :- At the end make sure both terminals are running i.e.<br>
>1) npm run json-server ➡ Starts Json Server
>2) npm run dev ➡ Starts React Application


## 🌐 API Endpoints (JSON Server)

| Method | Endpoint           | Description             |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| GET    | `/books`           | Get all books           |
| POST   | `/books`           | Add a new book          |
| PUT    | `/books/:id`       | Replace a book entirely |
| PATCH  | `/books/:id`       | Update fields in a book |
| DELETE | `/books/:id`       | Delete a book           |

## 🧠 Filtering & Searching Logic

- You can **search by title** using the search bar in the header.
- You can **filter by genre, author, or status** using the filter bar.
- If both search and filters are applied, results are combined (AND logic).
- If only one is used, results reflect that filter or search query alone.
